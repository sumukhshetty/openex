      section2: `State Of Ether Trade Today`,
      section3: `Our Vision`,
      section4: `Where We Are Right Now`,
      section5: `Road Ahead`,
      section1P1: `Our story starts amidst a blur of electric unicycles, morning yoga, and commune living in an organic farm on the outskirts of Bangalore. Quijano and Sumukh met at the Ethereum camp at Jaaga, found a shared love of the blockchain, and got motivated to make DApps together.`,
      section1P2: `However, they soon realised that the Ethereum ecosystem was still very nascent. Before trying to solve problems in automation, there was a liquidity problem staring at them. There was no simple, working method for buying and selling Ethereum for fiat currencies in India.`,
      section1caption1: `Building the stucture at Jaaga`,
      section1caption2: `The founding team at hillhacks`,
      section2P1: `Although its demand is global, buying and selling Ether for the local currency in each country is still an issue, especially in emerging markets. Centralized exchanges such as Coinbase don’t operate in most nations, charge high service fees, and require traders to keep Ether in the exchange’s wallets. Obtaining Ether often becomes a matter of obtaining Bitcoin first, and then trading it for Ether, adding friction and extra fees to the transaction.`,
      section2P2: `Most people in the ecosystem already know about the exponential growth of the ethereum blockchain. This is a great article by CodeTract that explains the different hockey stick graphs in the ethereum ecosystem. With a market capitalisation of over $30B we definitely believe that ether is here to stay.`,
      section2caption1: `caption`,
      section3P1: `A lot of countries that have bad financial infrastructure will be getting onto the ethereum blockchain for managing finances, because its a globally scalable system and a lot of decentralized fintech applications are being built, which need ether to run. This allows for underdeveloped countries to take part in the economy. But building centralized exchanges in all countries is not a possibility because of regulatory uncertainty and just because the technology is so cutting edge that a lot of people would find it hard to build a secure exchange.`,
      section3P2: `We believe that ethereum is going to play a very important role in the future of human society and an ether exchange would be most necessary in emerging markets. The markets maybe small for a centralized company like coinbase to get into, but a global solution like ours would make the most sense.`,
      section3P3: `The vision that we have is to provide a low cost decentralized solution to transact ether in different countries. We do this by using the ethereum blockchain to decentralize trust, and by building an easy to use interface for people to connect to the blockchain through their chrome/decentralized browser. We’d charge a small transaction fee for each succesful transaction and make sure that no one gets cheated by having a robust arbitration solution in case of disputes.`,
      section4P1: `The solution we saw was having a decentralised trading marketplace for ether, we built the whole solution using React, truffle, web3, metamask for wallet management, smart contracts for escrow and in the future uport for identity management.`,
      section4P2: `This also meant that our product would be global from day 1, and it would be much cheaper for the customer to use the platform compared to a centralised solution. As a customer, you end up paying for all the costs plus the profits of a centralised exchange. In our system, you’d pay a flat 1% fee and get the most competitive rates in the market.`,
      section4caption1: `Escrow happens on the blockchain through a smart contract`,
      section5P1: `The past 6 months we have experimented and moved from an idea to product. We know that as a core team we work great, but we need to get more people on board to scale globally.`,
      section5P2: `We also believe in the power of community, and think that ownership of the DAO should be with the stakeholders of the project. In the next few months, we intend to release a token that would allow us to create a better experience for our users and also help us fund development until we break even.`,
      section5P3: `Our goals for the next few months are to release a white paper in the next few months, make the product better as we have identified multiple challenges in the onboarding process for new users.`,
      section5P4: `We would act as a gateway platform for many users and educating the users on different aspects of decentralization is an important goal for us, and as of now we are creating a lot of content that would help users use dApps in general.`

We may also transfer your information during sale of assets or business to another company, de-merger into another company, while getting acquired by another company or getting merged with another company.By opening an account to use the Service (“Account”), you expressly represent and warrant that:
      11. You have accepted these Terms of Use;

      13. You are at least 18 years of age and have the full capacity to accept these Terms of Use and enter into a transaction involving Ethers. Risks The use of the Website and the Service may entail the following risks:
      14. Ether transactions are irreversible. The Ethers you buy will be sent to the Ether address provided. If you lose or delete your own Ether wallet, you will lose your Ethers in it and the same cannot be restored.
      15. Ether value tends to fluctuate on a minute to minute basis, due to which there may be increase or decrease in the value of the Ethers. Ethers are subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading in Ethers.
      16. Ether is an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of value transfer between individuals. It is not backed by any government or commodities and hence may be susceptible to risks not generally associated with government or central bank backed currencies.
      17. There is also the risk of loss of confidence in Ether trading, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in Ether because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers, the creation of superior competing alternatives, a deflationary or inflationary spiral, or due to governmental actions. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems, for instance, if the anonymity of the system is compromised, or if any entity is able to prevent any transactions from settling.
      18. There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in these Terms of Use.`,

      header: `Here’s why you should go with us.`,
      section1: `There’s a need for trustless mediation in markets`,
      section1P1: `The present method to trade ether is either to use ethexindia, which has stop accepting new users. The only other the method is first buying bitcoins with all the fees involved in buying bitcoin, and then converting the bitcoins to ether in some exchange, adding fees in the process again.`,
      section1P2: `This not only makes it hard and time consuming, but also expensive. This is why we believed that there needed to be a better way to solve this problem globally.`,
      section1P3: `When we started digging deeper, we realised we can build a much more secure product than anything out there by using the web3 stack where we use smart contracts on the blockchain for escrow processing and dispute resolution. The web3 stack also ensures that users are in full control of their funds as we do not store private keys in any centralized server. Every user accessing our site, has to do so through a decentralized browser, which has a unique wallet address. This also helps us bypass the email and password authentication the internet has been plagued with.`,
      section1P4: `Alright, so what?`,
      section1P5: `You can access our site only through a decentralised browser.`,
      section2: `You need resilient infrastructure when new technologies are involved`,
      section2T1: `What is a decentralized browser ?`,
      section2P1: `A decentralized browser is like any other browser with a few special properties. Each browser has a unique identity in the form of a public wallet address, which can store funds. This wallet can interact with dApps by connecting the user to the blockchain. So instead of using a centralized backend database, we can use an immutable database for core transactions. You retain ownership of your Ether independent of the service, letting you use Ether at your own will without asking us to give you access.`,
      section2T2: `So why should I care ?`,
      section2P2: ``,
      section2T3: `So?`,
      section2P3: `Because your funds are vulnerable in most exchanges, as they handle your private keys in centralised databases.`,
      section2P4: `Its basically like giving a website your bank account password, and in turn access to your funds. If the companies servers get hacked, your money is gone. If someone internally gets greedy, your money is gone.`,
      section2T4: `How do you handle private keys?`,
      section2P5: `Simple answer: We don’t !`,
      section2P6: `We basically never touch your private keys, as our application is a dApp you can access the site only through a decentralised browser, which means that when you log in, we sign an empty transaction to verify you are who you are. We do not use email and password to authenticate identity.`,
      section2T5: `Chrome/Firefox + Metamask = Decentralised Brower`,
      section2P7: `Metamask uses BIP39 to generate the private keys to your vault, they also don't store it. Only you have the seed which means only you can trade with it`,
      section2P8: `Metamask has a large user base and a proven track record of software maintenance and successful product feature releases since its been released. We believe that as the technology evolves Metamask will be able to keep up with the changing ecosystem.`,
      section3: `We’ll prepare you from the boom of upcoming Ethereum products and services`,
      section3P1: `We strongly believe that ethereum is going to be as disruptive to transactions as the internet was for information. There are extremely smart people work on problems such as peer to peer insurance, peer to peer credit, micropayments, replacing ad networks, supply chain, provenance, prediction markets, ROSCA’s, capital goods.`,
      section3P2: `All these are being developed and should be live in the next couple of months, but as of now there are already a bunch of live dApps that a user can make use of some of them being, ENS registrar, ICN, go to https://dapps.ethercasts.com/`,
      section3P3: `To run services on mosts dApp, a user requires ether. The biggest challenge for the user sometimes is getting his hands on ether. We want to make that easy for you. Our solution has one simple goal, to make buying and selling of ether, an easy and secure process.`,
      section3T1: `Service that support Ethereum right now:`,

      section3caption2: `service`,
      section3caption3: `service`,
      section3caption4: `service`,
      section4: `Fundamentally secure process`,
      section4T1: `Why do I have to transfer funds before the buyer pays me ?`,
      section4P1: `You are transferring the funds to a smart contract that holds the funds in escrow until the buyer pays you.`,
      section4T2: `What is a smart contract ?`,
      section4P2: `It is a piece of code on the blockchain that can’t be tampered with. In our application, the smart contract functions as the escrow contract, which holds the fund until you approve that the the buyer has sent the money to your account.`,
      section4T3: `What if the buyer tries to cheat me ?`,
      section4P3: `You can dispute the transaction, our support team will get in touch with both parties and look for proof of transaction. If there is no legitimate proof, we will send you back the eth to your wallet.`,
      section4T4: `What if the seller tries to cheat me ?`,
      section4P4: `The buyer has the rights to dispute the transaction to. Our support team will get in touch with both parties and look for proof of transaction. If there is a legitimate proof, we will send your wallet the eth.`,
      section4T5: `How can I trust the support team ?`,
      section4P5: `We also believe in the power of community, and think that ownership of the DAO should be with the stakeholders of the project. In the next few months, we intend to release a token that would allow us to create a better experience for our users and also help us fund development until we break even.`,
      section5: `We are completely transparent about fees`,
      section5P1: `We take a 1% fee for advertisers who post trades. No fees from direct buyers or seller. There are additional gas fees that go into the system which is again paid by the advertisers. This can vary, but gas fees are eventually going to decrease. As of now they are around 2$ per transaction but as ethereum scales, this problem should go away.`,
      section5P2: `We are looking at having a tiered pricing structure for our traders so that more frequent traders don’t end up loosing too much by trading. Traders end up making money  through the spread between buying and selling so it keeps the market efficient.`,
      section5P3: `A centralised exchange on the other hand could cost you anywhere between  2-5%. This is because they have a huge operational overhead compared to a system like ours and have to show their investors profits in the tunes of millions. Their only revenue stream being fees, can sometimes make them prohibitively expensive.`,
      section5P4: `We have seen other system that are similar (eg localbitcoins) which work very efficiently. We do not believe in overcharging our customers and by keeping a lean organization, we are able to charge much less than most other exchanges. `,
      section6: `Our system scales globally, and we really mean global.`,
      section6P1: `Unlike a centralized exchange that has bank accounts in each country they go to and come under the purview of regulators as business we are a marketplace that match buyers and sellers. This means that we can accept almost any form of bank/cash transfer as long as it verifiable by us (proof during dispute)`,
      section6P2: `A peer to peer exchange doesn’t come under the same regulations as a centralized exchange. We are not forced to do a KYC for every customer we have. But we are proactively doing a lite kyc using phone number verification. We expect all our users to follow their countries laws respectively and do not encourage them to use our system to break laws.`,
      section6P3: `Our goals for the next few months are to release a white paper, along with making the product better as we have identified multiple challenges in the onboarding process for new users.`
