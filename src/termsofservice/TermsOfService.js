            </p>
            <p>
            You may only use your own account to trade at Automte.com and you may only use one user account at a time for trading. You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), or any other codes that you use to access Automte. You are not allowed to sell, borrow, share or otherwise make available your account or any detail necessary to access your account to people or entities other than yourself. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Your account must not contain misleading or fraudulent information, including, but not limited to having a non-personal phone number, creating fake reputation information for your account, faking your country of origin or providing fraudulent identification documents. 
            </p>

            </p>

            </p>
            <h2 className='pv1'>Advertisements and trading</h2>
            <p>
            With a registered account you can create Ether trade advertisements ("advertisement" or "ad" or "ads") to advertise that you are purchasing or selling Ethers. You may initiate Ether trades ("trades" or "contacts") by contacting advertisements created by other users or wait for users to initiate trades with you by contacting ads created by yourself. 
            </p>
            <p>
            By initiating a Ether trade you agree to be bound by the advertisers terms of trade ("advertisers terms") set forth by the advertiser and displayed as terms of trade on the advertisement page. The terms of trade as determined by the advertiser are valid in all cases except when the advertisers terms contradict the Automte Terms of Service or are illegal or if both parties of the trade consent to alter the terms of trade. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The price or price equation that is defined in the advertisement must contain any and all fees that the advertiser requires the user initiating the trade to pay. After initiation of a trade the Ether price is locked and cannot be changed or any additional fees added without consent from both parties of the trade and Automte.com. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Ether advertisements must be placed in the correct payment category, if a category does not exist for the payment method it must be placed in the Other category. 
            </p>
            <p>
            We may hide, remove, or limit your advertisements, if you violate these Terms of Service or any other agreement you enter into with Automte, or as otherwise specified in these Terms of Service or other agreement you have entered into with Automte. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Valid payment details must be provided through the Automte trade system. It is a violation of this terms of service to provide payment details through other communication channels. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In case a payment made by a Ether buyer to a seller is frozen, held, reversed, charged back or in other ways withheld from the Ether seller the buyer will be considered in breach of these terms of service. User information of the buyer can be provided to the seller to assist in recovery of the funds. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Ether must be held in escrow during the whole trade process until the seller has received payment in full. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Ether buyers must be able to, upon request by Automte, provide adequate proof of payment for up to 180 days after the trade has been completed. 
            </p>
            <p>
            We use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your account, your ads and your trades. If we find your account to pose a high risk to Automte or our customers we will consider you in breach of these terms of service and may temporarily limit your account and freeze your Ether wallet in accordance with these terms of service.
            </p>
            <h2 className='pv1'>Online advertisements</h2>
            <p>
            Online advertisements ("Online ads" or "Online advertisements") are advertisements in the categories "Buy Ethers online" and "Sell Ethers online" or any other advertisement where the payment method is any other than cash or the advertisement type is online buy or online sell.
            </p>
            <p>
            You are allowed to have active ads with only one account at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
            You must place your ads in the correct payment category.
            </p>
            <p>
            Multiple ads for the same payment method are not allowed in the same country unless the ads are limited to certain customer groups and the advertisements have a price difference of at least 3%.
            </p>
            <h2 className='pv1'>Accounts verified as company</h2>
            <p>
            A user account can be verified as a company account. Accounts that are company verified are allowed the following exemptions from these terms: 
            </p>
            <p>
            A company may have several active user accounts at any time, provided they are all company verified and operated by an empl ee of the company. Each company verified account is personal to the empl ee operating it. 
            </p>
            <p>
            A company may have active advertisements from several accounts with the following exceptions:
            </p>
            <p>
            Ads are not allowed to overlap between accounts. E.g. you’re not allowed to create advertisements using the same limits with the same price in the same payment method category in the same country.
            </p>
            <p>
            Multiple advertisements for the same payment method in the same country are not allowed if they have the same price and don’t have at least one of the following differences:
            </p>
            <p>
            Minimum and Maximum transaction limit is not allowed to overlap.
            </p>
            <h2 className='pv1'>Disputes with Ether trades</h2>
            <p>
            If the buyer and seller of a Ether trade are in disagreement over a trade either party or Automte may initiate a dispute. Disputed trades are resolved by Automte.com support staff. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Automte.com support resolves disputes by carefully evaluating the terms of trade, payment evidence, trade chat messages, user reputation, other data submitted to us by our users and data collected by us as part of the privacy policy. 
            </p>
            <p>
            When sellers turn unresponsive, we will resolve the dispute to the buyer if we are confident the seller has received valid payment from the buyer. If the buyer is unresponsive the seller may dispute the trade and we will resolve the dispute to the seller. 
            </p>
            <p>
            After the trade has been released by the seller, cancelled by the buyer or automatically cancelled due to not being marked as paid the trade is considered finished and cannot be disputed, reversed or altered. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Providing fraudulent information or documents in a dispute or making false claims or otherwise trying to force a certain outcome of a disputed trade is considered a violation of this agreement. If payment details are provided outside of Automte the dispute may be resolved without taking the payment details into consideration.
            </p>
