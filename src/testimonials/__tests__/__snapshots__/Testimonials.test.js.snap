        "about.section1": "Unusual Beginnings",
        "about.section1P1": "Our story starts amidst a blur of electric unicycles, morning yoga, and commune living in an organic farm on the outskirts of Bangalore. Quijano and Sumukh met at the Ethereum camp at Jaaga, found a shared love of the blockchain, and got motivated to make DApps together.",
        "about.section1P2": "However, they soon realised that the Ethereum ecosystem was still very nascent. Before trying to solve problems in automation, there was a liquidity problem staring at them. There was no simple, working method for buying and selling Ethereum for fiat currencies in India.",

        "about.section1caption2": "capton 2",
        "about.section2": "State Of Ether Trade Today",
        "about.section2P1": "Although its demand is global, buying and selling Ether for the local currency in each country is still an issue, especially in emerging markets. Centralized exchanges such as Coinbase don’t operate in most nations, charge high service fees, and require traders to keep Ether in the exchange’s wallets. Obtaining Ether often becomes a matter of obtaining Bitcoin first, and then trading it for Ether, adding friction and extra fees to the transaction.",
        "about.section2P2": "Most people in the ecosystem already know about the exponential growth of the ethereum blockcain. This is a great article by codetract that explains the different hockey stick graphs in the ethereum ecosystem. With a market cap of over $7B we definitely believe that ether is here to stay.",
        "about.section2caption1": "caption",
        "about.section3": "Our Vision",
        "about.section3P1": "A lot of countries that have bad financial infrastructure will be getting onto the ethereum blockchain for managing finances, because its a globally scalable system and a lot of decentralized fintech applications are being built, which need ether to run. This allows for underdeveloped countries to take part in the economy. But building centralized exchanges in all countries is not a possibility because of regulatory uncertainty and just because the technology is so cutting edge that a lot of people would find it hard to build a secure exchange.",
        "about.section3P2": "We believe that ethereum is going to play a very important role in the future of human society and an ether exchange would be most necessary in emerging markets. The markets maybe small for a centralized company like coinbase to get into, but a global solution like ours would make the most sense.",
        "about.section3P3": "The vision that we have is to provide a low cost decentralized solution to transact ether in different countries. We do this by using the ethereum blockchain to decentralize trust, and by building an easy to use interface for people to connect to the blockchain through their chrome/decentralized browser. We’d charge a small transaction fee for each succesful transaction and make sure that no one gets cheated by having a robust arbitration solution in case of disputes.",
        "about.section4": "Where We Are Right Now",
        "about.section4P1": "The solution we saw was having a decentralised trading marketplace for ether, we built the whole solution using React, truffle, web3, metamask for wallet management, smart contracts for escrow and in the future uport for identity management.",
        "about.section4P2": "This also meant that our product would be global from day 1, and it would be much cheaper for the customer to use the platform compared to a centralised solution. As a customer, you end up paying for all the costs plus the profits of a centralised exchange. In our system, you’d pay a flat 1% fee and get the most competitive rates in the market.",
        "about.section5": "Road Ahead",
        "about.section5P1": "The past 6 months we have experimented and moved from an idea to product. We know that as a core team we work great, but we need to get more people on board to scale globally.",
        "about.section5P2": "We also believe in the power of community, and think that ownership of the DAO should be with the stakeholders of the project. In the next few months, we intend to release a token that would allow us to create a better experience for our users and also help us fund development until we breakeven.",
        "about.section5P3": "Our goals for the next few months are to release a white paper in the next few months, make the product better as we have identified multiple challenges in the onboarding process for new users.",
        "about.section5P4": "We would act as a gateway platform for many users and educating the users on different aspects of decentralization is an important goal for us, and as of now we are creating a lot of content that would help users use dApps in general.",
        "about.sumukhBio": "I build products that solve real world  problems. I have been an avid bitcoin and blockchain enthusiast for the past 4 years, an early investor & miner in Bitcoin. I have worked as a business developer, sales & marketing intern, web developer, UX designer.",

        "how.section2": "You need resilient infrastructure when new technologies are involved",
        "how.section2P1": "A decentralized browser is like any other browser with a few special properties. Each browser has a unique identity in the form of a public wallet address, which can store funds. This wallet can interact with dApps by connecting the user to the blockchain. So instead of using a centralized backend database, we can use an immutable database for core transactions.",
        "how.section2P2": "You retain ownership of your Ether independent of the service, letting you use Ether at your own will without asking us to give you access.",
        "how.section2P3": "Because your funds are vulnerable in most exchanges, as they handle your private keys in centralised databases.",
        "how.section2P4": "Its basically like giving a website your bank account password, and in turn access to your funds. If the companies servers get hacked, your money is gone. If someone internally gets greedy, your money is gone.",

        "how.section3": "We’ll prepare you from the boom of upcoming Ethereum products and services",
        "how.section3P1": "We basically never touch your private keys, as our application is a dApp you can access the site only through a decentralised browser, which means that when log in, we sign an empty transaction to verify you are who you are. We do not use email and password to authenticate identity.",
        "how.section3P2": "Metamask uses BIP39 to generate the private keys to your vault, they also don't store it. Only you have the seed which means only you can trade with it",
        "how.section3P3": "Metamask has a large user base and a proven track record of software maintenance and successful product feature releases since its been released. We believe that as the technology evolves Metamask will be able to keep up with the changing ecosystem.",

        "how.section4P2": "It is a piece of code on the blockchain that can’t be tampered with. In our application, the smart contract functions as the escrow contract, which holds the fund until you approve that the the buyer has sent the money to your account.",
        "how.section4P3": "You can dispute the transaction, our support team will get in touch with both parties and look for proof of transaction. If there is no legitimate proof, we will send you back the eth to your wallet",

When you transact with a seller using ezether smart contracts you can be sure that the amount of ether that you've requested is safe and that the seller can only do two things - release the ether to you once you've made a payment or raise a dispute. If you pay the seller the amount in the contract and can prove that you've paid then there's no way that you can be cheated.",

      15. Ether value tends to fluctuate on a minute to minute basis, due to which there may be increase or decrease in the value of the Ethers. Ethers are subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading in Ethers.
      16. Ether is an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of value transfer between individuals. It is not backed by any government or commodities and hence may be susceptible to risks not generally associated with government or central bank backed currencies.
      17. There is also the risk of loss of confidence in Ether trading, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in Ether because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers, the creation of superior competing alternatives, a deflationary or inflationary spiral, or due to governmental actions. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems, for instance, if the anonymity of the system is compromised, or if any entity is able to prevent any transactions from settling.
