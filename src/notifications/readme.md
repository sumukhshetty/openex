I merged all of the code in this folder into a single /Notifications.js file. I also edited all teh refrences in other files to it. I changed it because the existing folder structure was unecessarily complex for the simplicity of the module.

If the Notifications file starts becoming more complex again we can just create a new folder called Notifications and move the file into it and rename the current file index.js
