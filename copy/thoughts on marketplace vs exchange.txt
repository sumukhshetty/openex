QJ had questioned me earlier about the differences in calling the product a marketplace v/s an exchange.

I found parallels in this with Eric S Raymond's essay The Cathedral and The Bazaar, an essay about the open-source vs closed source model.

Exchanges act like Cathedrals, a top-down setting, having their own non-negotiable price, 
leaving the user with the a single choice - is this price good for me or not.

The trust in, or reliability of the system is a straightforward choice, you trust the exchange or you don't.

It helps to think of Marketplaces in terms of the word 'Bazaar', and the hustle and bustle involved therein.
On reflection, the key ideas become choice and adaptability.

Marketplaces provide more variability, in price and user reputation. Marketplacess are more nimble, a seller might
see others accepting PayTM and decided to accept PayTM himself, rather than the slow process of an exchange adding
a payment method. Or there can be a user anticipating price going up or down, and be willing to deviate from the
standard rates everyone else is using.

Particularly in a global marketplace, the differentiator then becomes payment method, maybe even having scope for bartering work hours or physical objects for ether.

I just felt we should keep this in mind whenever we talk about automte/ezether being a marketplace.
