QJ had questioned me earlier about the differences in calling yourself a marketplace v/s an exchange.

I found parallels in this with Eric S Raymond's essay The Cathedral and The Bazaar.

Exchanges act like Cathedrals, a top-down setting, having their own non-negotiable price, 
leaving the user with the a single choice - is this price good for me or not.

The trustability or reliability of the system is a straightforward choice, do you trust the exchange or not.

It helps to think of Marketplaces with the word Bazaar, and the key ideas become choice and adaptability.
Marketplaces provide more variability, in price and user reputation. Markets are more nimble, a seller might
see others accepting PayTM and decided to accept PayTM himself, rather than the slow process of an exchange adding
a payment method.

I think independence of the wallet also aligns more with the marketplace, aligning more with the real life experience
of carrying cash v/s centralised escrow wallets akin to putting money in a food court card in a mall.
